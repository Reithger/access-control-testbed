# access-control-testbed
This project will apply access control algorithms to a CPS testbed, namely an IoT testbed consisting of several appliances that interact with a smart meter, to evaluate security properties of CPS. CPS are engineered systems that rely on interactive networks of physical and computational components. These components have a degree of autonomy in that they can easily join or leave the network, making the overall network behavior much more dynamic. Existing control algorithms do not account for this.
